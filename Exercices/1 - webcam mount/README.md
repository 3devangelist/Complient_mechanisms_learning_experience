# Logitech C910 Screen Mount

## Introduction
Welcome to the Logitech C910 Screen Mount project! This repository documents the design and creation of a custom mount specifically tailored for the Logitech C910 screen. This mount provides a secure and adjustable solution for conveniently positioning the screen during use.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to develop a functional and ergonomic mount that enhances the usability of the Logitech C910 screen. By designing a custom solution, we aim to address any limitations or discomfort associated with the default mounting options provided by the manufacturer.

## Features
The Logitech C910 Screen Mount offers several key features:

- Secure attachment: The mount ensures a stable and secure attachment of the Logitech C910 screen, minimizing any unwanted movement or vibrations.
- Adjustable positioning: The mount provides flexibility in positioning the screen at various angles and heights, allowing for optimal viewing and comfortable use.
- Easy installation: With a user-friendly design, the mount is simple to install and can be easily adjusted or removed as needed.
- Compatibility: The mount is specifically designed to fit the dimensions and specifications of the Logitech C910 screen, ensuring a perfect fit.
- Low on plastic use.

## Process

The creation of the Logitech C910 Screen Mount involved a process that spanned approximately 5 hours, with interruptions on June 4, 2023, due to a family dinner.

### Software
For this project, Fusion 360 was utilized as the primary software tool. Its versatility and accessibility make it suitable for collaborating with others.

### Initial Concepts
In the initial stages, the focus was on utilizing flexibility to achieve a change in states, similar to the concept found here: [Example Concept](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3163115).

However, this approach did not work at all, because they dint deform as I thought. It became evident that a fixed-state mount was preferred, providing stability and eliminating any unintended movement and I think is simpler.

### Prototyping and Testing
Light at the end of the tunnel!

The first One that works the problem is low deformation e need more!

Multiple prototypes were printed using a 3D printer to validate the design and assess its functionality. Each iteration provided valuable insights and opportunities for improvements.

### Final Design
After multiple iterations, a final design was achieved that met the project objectives. The Logitech C910 Screen Mount offers a secure and adjustable solution, providing a stable platform for the screen while allowing for personalized positioning. I have model custom support material to use less material!

To secure the camera I have used this bolt!

I have used a 0.6 nozzle it was what I had mounted on the printer, if use a 0.4 you may need to change the settings!

Be careful with the seems!

### Conclusion

I've been thinking about the design, and I believe it would be awesome if we could make it even more flexible. You know, something that not only holds the monitors securely but also provides a bit of cushioning and can accommodate a wider range of monitor thicknesses.
I want to make sure that when someone places their monitor, it feels snug and secure, regardless of its thickness. So, if i have time i will exploring some cool modifications to the design to achieve that.

Thanks for being part of this exciting journey of design! Let's make it awesome!
The process of creating the Logitech C910 Screen Mount was an iterative journey of exploration and refinement. It involved overcoming challenges and learning from failures to arrive at a functional and efficient solution. I hope this documentation provides valuable insights and serves as a resource for others interested in creating their own customized screen mounts.
